Web application that is meant to manage the 400,000+ yearly access requests to the Brest Naval Base. 
Build an experimental version of the app.
- The app addresses a security concern for the naval base while improving the management and oversight of the demand validation process. 
- Adaptable to the 19 other bases of the French Navy, thanks to admin roles that allow the creation of entities, zone configuration, and modification of validation processes.

Obviously, the code is property of the French Navy (Marine Nationale) hence this repository is only meant to explain the project and share my internship report during which I coded this app.
